# Flutter Instagram Clone Task

Hello students, I hope you are doing very well. The following points are the list of tasks that you need to complete.

1. Create new firebase project and link that project to this project
2. Implement the app's authentication system, including login and signup Screen
3. Create the app's home screen, which should display a feed of photos, like, comment, and share options, and a search bar (Page 1).
4. To add a photo and send to Firebase, use page 3 (Hint: use `image_picker` package)
5. Build a user profile screen that displays a user's posts, followers, following, and edit profile options (Page 4)
6. Build a Explore screen that displays different posts (Page 2)

You can create your own designs of login, signup, profile, home screens or you can get reference from your own instagram app or from here: [https://screenlane.com/screens/product/instagram/](https://screenlane.com/screens/product/instagram/)

Points to be noted:

1. Use of firebase for Authentication and Storing Data using collections
2. Implementation of Notifications of likes and comment from another users using Firebase is a plus point
3. Implementation of Chat using firebase will be a major plus point.
4. As soon as you get the project file, do add it to Github first then add your team members as Github collaborator.
5. Github Repo: [https://github.com/slimpotatoboy/ig_clone](https://github.com/slimpotatoboy/ig_clone)
6. You can you any packages that are required for the app. For eg. You can use **`flutter_local_notifications` for showing notifications on the app**
